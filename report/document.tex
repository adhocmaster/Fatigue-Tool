% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors

\begin{abstract}
Mental fatigue reduces the cognitive and physical performance of people. 
I propose to investigate how mental fatigue affects programmers to perform 
poor in software industries, causing system developed by them to fail in the 
long run. This project is the part of my thesis research project under 
\textit{Dr. Parnin}\footnote{http://www.chrisparnin.me/}. We will be
validating our hypothesis with the help of surveys and user studies. 
This project is to define the research guidelines to further investigate
different methods to automatically determine the fatigue level of programmers.  
We can use this information to help programmers avoid their fatigue state to
control errors in programming, and eventually aid them to be more productive.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fatigue: exhaustion, tiredness, lethargy, languidness, languor,
  lassitude, and listlessness. Leads to cognitive failures like distraction, low
  decision power, less reasoning capabilities, and poor attention and focus.
  \cite{larson:cogFailures}
  \item Exhaustion due to extreme mental and physical work causes performance
  degradation in execution of human tasks. Mental fatigue has also a negative
  effect on memory and cognitive functionalities and these functionalities play
  a vital role in a program construction and modeling.
  \cite{schneiderman:interaction}
  \item Primary reasons for system failures are due to low performance of programmers,
  caused by their absentmindedness or exhaustion. Mental fatigue can also lead
  to system failures in the long run.
  \item Programmers may create mistakes and therefore may introduce bugs in
  software development. These mental errors are due to cognitive failures like
  distraction, low decision power, less reasoning capabilities, and poor
  attention and focus. \cite{larson:cogFailures}
  \item Subjective feelings of fatigue in performing general tasks [Needs to be
  modified]
  \cite{saito:industry}
  \begin{enumerate}
   		\item Dull Drowsy
   		\begin{enumerate}
   		  \item \ldots
   		\end{enumerate}
   		\item Exhausted
   		\begin{enumerate}
   		  \item \ldots
   		\end{enumerate}
   		\item Mental decline of working motivation
   		\begin{enumerate}
   		  \item \ldots
   		\end{enumerate}
   		\item Specific feeling of incongruity in body
   		\begin{enumerate}
   		  \item \ldots
   		\end{enumerate}
   		\item Dysfunction of autonomic nervous systems
   		\begin{enumerate}
   		  \item \ldots
   		\end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item There is not a lot work done in this problem area, so my approach would be to
create incremental models that can be refined over time with continuous evaluation 
of the research. 
  \item My contribution intends to define some measurements for measuring the
  mental fatigue and analyzing its effect on developers' performance. This is a
  step towards working to solve the problem of programmers' mental fatigue
  affecting various programming tasks in the software development process.
  \item In summary, we make the following contributions [Section wise
  description]
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Empirical studies have been conducted in the cognitive aspects 
of software engineering. Khan et. al. \cite{khan:mood} have worked on the effect 
of programmers' moods on the performance of programming debugging, 
which also comes under the umbrella of psychological causes. 
My approach takes mental fatigue as the psychological factor 
rather than mood and focuses on all the programming tasks than just 
on program debugging. Pimenta et. al.
\cite{pimenta:monitor} \cite{pimenta:analysis} have worked on monitoring and
analyzing the human performance with respect to the computers and the effects 
of fatigue on it. My proposal is the extension of 
this approach by using different ways to analyze the effects of 
fatigue and providing an aid to the programmer. Saito \cite{saito:industry} has worked 
on assessment of physical fatigue in industries. Several works 
have been done on the risk of cognitive incapability of other 
types of work like driving or physical activities in industries, 
however, few works have been done about finding risk in the programming 
tasks of IT personals.\\
Numerous articles and blogs discuss about the effect of fatigue 
on the efficacy of programmers in tasks like program understanding, 
construction, modeling, debugging and decision making. 
Industries need a tool which can help programmers detect the mental 
fatigue state and work on it.\\
This proposed project is first of the many steps taken in this 
direction, opening a wider scope for more research in the domain.


\section{Methodologies}
The approach is to validate our hypothesis and then set some research
guidelines to investigate methods to determine fatigue state of programmers. A
case study to try setting some benchmark, which includes initial
experimental validation using an instrumentation tool (Eclipse plug-in). 

\subsection{Validating Hypothesis: Survey}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to validate the hypothesis of mental fatigue
  deteriorting programmers' performance and to resolve the dilemma of
  quantifying and measuring fatigue with respect to the programming tasks, we
  intend to build a novel model to classify fatigue and relate that to the
  programming tasks. However, to achieve that, we must need to set some
  guidelines on the basis of which we will be able to quatify and define
  fatigue. This includes important research questions to be answered. \\
  R1-R10 \ldots
  \item We conducted a survey and got 311 participants to respond. The age
  distribution of the participants lies mostly between 20 and 60 [Figure 1].
  Repondents' answers helped us gather data about fatigue and investigate
  possible detection and alleviation mechanisms.
  \item The survey consists of three parts: questions about sleep habits and
  fatigue levels, questions about fatigue and work performance and question
  about work habits.

  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Eligibility
  	\item Selection
  	\item Community etc \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Results}
The results of our survey show programmers' view towards fatigue. It helped
us identify the factors leading to mental fatigue and it's influence on the
performance of any programming task. In addition, several implications allow us
to speculate on the way programmers behave when they are in the fatigue state.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Analysis of the research questions R1-R10 [Sample: Figure 2-4]
   \begin{figure}

	\caption{Actions taken when tired.}
   \end{figure}
  	\begin{enumerate}
   		\item R1
   		\item R2 
   		\item \ldots
    \end{enumerate}
   \begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,natwidth=913,natheight=659]{influenced.png}
	\caption{Factors influencing the performance.}
   \end{figure}
  \item Implications of the research questions to set guidelines for
  investigation [Sample: Figure 5]
  \item Although our formative study provides data on how programmers think of
  fatigue and how fatgiue affect their performance in programming tasks. There
  are several threats to validity that should be considered when interpreting our results.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Validation: Instrumentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To investigate the usefulness of identifying fatigue during programming
  tasks and recognizing its impact on the performance, we evaluated the
  outcome of the survey study by conducting some other empirical studies of
  programmers.
  \item We implemented our technique as a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE.
  DevFatigue is an activity tracking plug-in for Eclipse. It is an extension of
  Rabbit \\
  https://code.google.com/p/rabbit-eclipse/. Alike Rabbit, it works in
  the background with Eclipse and tracks all the activities you perform. It only
  tracks the actions when Eclipse is active. And logs the data in XML (human
  readable) format at specific location.
  Use this update site URL for installation: \\

  \item Indicators of mental fatigue recorded by DevFatigue
  	\begin{enumerate}
   		\item Keydown Time
   		\item Errors per Key Pressed
   		\item Mouse Velocity
   		\item Mouse Acceleration
   		\item Time between Keys
   		\item Double Click Speed
   		\item Number of Double Clicks
   		\item Distance While Clicking etc \ldots
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The architecture of the proposed framework is the extension of the used
  in some of the previous studies. \cite{pimenta:analysis}
  \cite{pimenta:monitor}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,natwidth=942,natheight=668]{focus.png}
	\caption{Focus Curve.}
  \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hack-a-thons}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Overnight programming competition are always motivating and provides a
  platform for programmers to work towards solving a problem. A hackathon is an
  coding event where computer programmers collaborate in building a software
  product.
  \item LexisNexis organized a fall hack-a-thon on 23rd Oct 2014. We approached
  few of the participants. All of the participants were graduate students of
  the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University (here
  after refered as NCSU).
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Eligibility
  	\item Selection
  	\item Community etc \ldots
  \end{itemize}
  \item Of the 13 participants invited to participate in the study, only 2
  participants finished the study and turned in the data by
  DevFatigue.
  \item We collected data using the log files dumped by DevFatigue, and a
  post-study questionnaire.
  \item Data selection [TODO]
  \item Building a model and classifying mental fatigue [TODO]
  \item Observations from analysis [TODO] \\
  We intend to come up with a focus curve [Dummy: Figure 6] that can show some
  working pattern of the user and build a model based on the data collected to classify fatigue
  depending on the user's activities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{In class study}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dr. Parnin is teaching CSC 510 Software Engineering in Fall 2014 at
  NCSU. Most students in the course have some coding experience. 
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Eligibility
  	\item Selection
  	\item Community etc \ldots
  \end{itemize}
  \item Dr. Parnin asked the students to install DevFatigue and let it track
  their activies on Eclipse, for a time-period. In addition, we asked them to
  log their daily sleep hours.
  \item Of the 100 students enrolled in the course, [X] students responded
  against the extra credit offered in the course.
  \item Data selection [TODO]
  \item Building a model and classifying mental fatigue [TODO]
  \item Observations from analysis [TODO]
\end{itemize}

\section{Study Results \& Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discussing how the set research guidelines are used in analysis.
  \item How the user patterns \& analysis results depicts fatique, with 
  respect to the indicators.
  \item Discussion about the observations from the result and other methodologies which
can be used in order to achieve the goal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{More Methodologies}
\subsubsection{In-Lab study}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The study of mental fatigue, including its causes and symptoms, is
  traditionally supported by data collected through
  instrumentation, self-reporting mechanisms (generally questionnaires) or, more
  recently, through the use of physiological sensors.
  \cite{pimenta:monitor}
  \item Specific programming tasks [TODO]
  \item We will collect data using the pre-study questionnarire, log files
  dumped by DevFatigue, and a post-study questionnaire.
  \item Electrical conductance is the method of measuring Galvanic skin response
  (GSR) monitoring sweat gland activity. We are using GSR to measure the fatigue
  activity level and validate the data collected and analysed by DevFatigue.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Detect
  	\item Validate
  	\item Analysis
  	\item Result
  \end{itemize}
  \item Finding patterns and setting benchmark [TODO]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Industrial study}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our research aims to help programmers avoid their fatigue state to
  control errors in programming, and eventually aid them for a better
  productivity. The application would be most suitable for the software
  industry. We have a lot of different programming tasks in an industry and
  fatigue might affect the performance/productivity of any of those
  activities. Thus, we will try conducting some studies on the real environment
  programming activities.
  \item In today's competitive world, software programmers are motivated to work
  hard, and hence keep themselves involved in numerous projects. Sometimes they
  work in teams and sometime they work individually on a project. Again, this
  all lead to sleepless nights resulting in more exhaustion and tiredness.
  \item To check the relation between mental fatigue and performance, We plan to
  review bug and code logs. My research would be taking the factors like working
  scenarios and behaviors, which affect performance, into consideration as well.
  Smith et. al. \cite{smith:coffee} studied the effects of intake of coffee on
  alertness and performance. Coetzer and Richmond \cite{richmond:team} performed
  an empirical analysis on working in teams and its relation with performance.
  \item Analysing their work patterns \& daily routines [TODO]
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item A summary about the whole process. What all we have achieved. 
How the model and the study can be used in helping the software industry.
Talking about few contributions the study can make to the industry.
Application of the proved hypothesis.
\item After setting the baseline and recognizing fatigue states, the next step
would be to help programmers to overcome the fatigue state. It could be achieved
by various alerts, screen freezes or even suggesting Pomodoro technique. The
research is to conduct, monitor, and analyze data in a non-invasive and
non-intrusive way and present the results in a cordial manner.
