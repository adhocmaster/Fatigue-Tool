We are [researchers](http://www.chrisparnin.me) conducting a survey on **fatigue** and programming.  

We previously studied other factors of in the workplace (e.g., [Programmer, Interrupted](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/)).  Your answers will help researchers gather data about fatigue and investigate possible detection and alleviation mechanisms.  This will also help us understand and investigate an opposite state of fatigue: **flow**.
