We are [researchers](http://www.chrisparnin.me/) conducting a survey on **fatigue** and programming.

We previously studied other factors of in the workplace (e.g., [Programmer, Interrupted](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/)). Your answers will help researchers gather data about fatigue and investigate possible detection and alleviation mechanisms. This will also help us understand and investigate an opposite state of fatigue: **flow**.

DevFatigue
-----------

[DevFatigue](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~ssarkar4/fatigue/eclipse/updatesite/) is an activity tracking plug-in for Eclipse. It is an extension of [Rabbit](https://code.google.com/p/rabbit-eclipse/). Alike Rabbit, it works in the background with Eclipse and tracks all the activities you perform. It only tracks the actions when Eclipse is active. And logs the data in XML (human readable) format at specific location. 

Rabbit provides a user interface to retrieve the data in its view. As the DevFatigue is still in development, among the additional features, it just provides a graphical interface for User Activity data, though the other features logs are also available.

The log files can be obtained at specific location like:

`Windows -> C:\Users\{USER}\Rabbit\`

`Linux|Mac -> /Users/{USER}/Rabbit/`

### Instrumentation (Upload Data - Single File)

As the instructions provided on CSC 510 board, you would need to install the plug-in. And let it track your activities on Eclipse

Please find the log files at the above path. **Compress** and upload all the data in the `Rabbit` directory.

### Self evaluation (Manual logging - hours)

Please log your daily sleeping timings for the same time period.

Either just type in the information in a *comma separated version*

or

Upload an *excel|csv* file containing the data
